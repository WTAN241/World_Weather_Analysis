# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
After the big success of the PlanMyTrip app, the team recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. The most important change they requested was to add a weather description to the weather data already retrieved so that the customers could understand the travel destination better. This analysis consists of three parts:

### 1. Retrieve Weather Data
In this part, a set of around 2,000 latitudes and longitudes will be generated. Then these coordinates will be used to find the nearest cities and the weather data (maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and weather description). This data will be compiled into a dataframe.
### 2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
This part will provide the customer with the opportunity to retrieve weather preferences and then identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels according to these preferences. Pop-up markers will be available on the map that shows weather data details.
### 3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map for Four Cities
In this part, the customer will be allowed to choose 4 cities that could be possible travel destinations and the travel mode. Then, a marker layer map with pop-up markers for each city will provide details for the customer about the travel route as well as the weather details for each city.
